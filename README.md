Official Man Power Billing System Full Code/Programming 

The Manpower Billing System is a specialized solution designed to streamline manpower deployment and billing processes for various banks. Through our software, we provide trained bank manpower resources, manage their onboarding by collecting essential details such as Aadhaar card, PAN card, and phone numbers, and store them in a centralized Master Billing System. Once manpower is deployed, annexures are generated and submitted to the respective bank client managers for approval. After approval, payments to the banks are processed within 2 to 5 working days, excluding Saturdays and bank holidays. We ensure strict compliance by creating and managing PF accounts for all manpower within 2.5 months of deployment. Payments are scheduled and released in a calendar-wise manner to maintain consistency and reliability. Additionally, a dedicated help desk team supports employees and clients through a complaint management system integrated with a live chat box, ensuring smooth communication and quick resolution of issues. This system enhances operational efficiency and ensures timely service delivery in the banking manpower domain. , in marathi
